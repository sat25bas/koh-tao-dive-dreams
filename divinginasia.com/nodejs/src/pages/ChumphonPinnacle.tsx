      detailedDescription="Chumphon Pinnacle is one of Koh Tao's most spectacular deep dive sites, located 30 minutes offshore. This granite pinnacle rises dramatically from the deep ocean floor, creating a natural cleaning station for large marine life. The site is particularly famous for its reliable whaleshark sightings, with these gentle giants often cruising the depths. Massive schools of trevally and chevron barracuda create mesmerizing displays, while eagle rays and other pelagics add to the excitement. The pinnacle's structure provides excellent swim-through opportunities and photographic subjects."
