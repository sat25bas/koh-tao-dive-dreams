      detailedDescription="One of the most difficult fish to spot in Koh Tao's waters, the bearded scorpion fish is a master of disguise.

Finding these cryptic predators requires patience, careful observation, and an experienced guide. Their venomous spines serve as a defense mechanism against predators."
