      detailedDescription="The banded sea krait is one of the most intriguing marine animals found in Koh Tao's shallow waters. Despite being one of the most venomous sea snakes in the world, they are generally docile and rarely bite unless provoked. Their distinctive black and blue banding makes them unmistakable, and watching them hunt in shallow reef areas is a unique experience. They must surface to breathe air every 30-40 minutes, creating opportunities for observation and photography."
