      detailedDescription="HTMS Sattakut is a fascinating WWII-era ex-US Navy vessel deliberately sunk in 2011 to create an artificial reef. This 30-meter long wreck lies between Koh Tao and Koh Nang Yuan at depths of 18-30 meters. The wreck has become a thriving artificial reef, completely covered in corals and home to a diverse array of marine life. The ship's structure provides excellent swim-through opportunities, from the engine room to the bridge. Large groupers, snappers, and barracuda now call this wreck home, and it's become a premier wreck diving destination in Southeast Asia."
