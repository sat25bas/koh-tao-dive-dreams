      detailedDescription="The hawksbill sea turtle is a critically endangered species with a distinctive beak-like mouth perfectly adapted for reaching into crevices to extract sponges and other small marine organisms. Their beautiful shells feature overlapping scales that create a mosaic pattern, and they play an important role in maintaining coral reef ecosystems by controlling sponge populations. Hawksbills are much more elusive than green sea turtles and require careful, patient observation. Their presence indicates a healthy coral reef ecosystem, making every sighting particularly special for divers and snorkelers."
