This intermediate dive site features a stunning variety of coral formations, from colorful soft corals to massive gorgonians. The site is renowned for its healthy coral coverage and abundant marine life. Pink-tailed triggerfish, rarely seen elsewhere in Koh Tao, make this site particularly special.
